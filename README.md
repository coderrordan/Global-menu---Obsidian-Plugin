## 🛠️ Contributing
This plugin started as a "vibe coding" session because I genuinely needed this functionality, even though I hadn't coded in years. What began as a simple idea quickly evolved, and I found myself diving deeper into its development. Your ideas, bug reports, and pull requests are highly welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
